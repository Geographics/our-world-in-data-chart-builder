This is the case, for example, with OECD figures. However, in this dataset we take the WHO definition as a basis, and hence capital expenditures are included.\\n\\nWhether reporting agencies include capital expenditure as part of healthcare expenditure depends on the System of Health Accounts (SHA) that is in place. The OECD figures use the SHA 2011, which is the latest revision. The WHO figure use a previous version.\\n\\nWhile it is widely accepted that the SHA 2011 is superior to previous versions, many countries still use previous versions. This means there is a tradeoff between coverage across countries, and data quality. In the interest of coverage, we have chosen to rely on WHO definitions.\\n\\nHandling of underlying sources\\n\\nThis dataset was constructed by combining four sources.

Here is an example:\\n\\nWHO_(year-1)= WHO_year x [OECD.stat_(year-1)]/[OECD.stat_(year)]\\n\\nBackward extrapolation was necessary because the levels in the estimates from WHO GHED, OECD.stat and OECD (1993) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. This is partly because OECD.stat data does not include capital expenditure.\\n\\nThe implicit assumption in our constructed dataset, then, is that the estimates from these three series have different levels, but common trends.

In some studies and reports, education is included in social spending. This is not the case in this dataset.\\n\\nHandling of underlying sources\\n\\nThis dataset was constructed by combining three sources. These are the OECD Social Expenditure Database (OECD SOCX), OECD (1985) and Lindert (2004).\\n\\nThese three sources were combined as follows. For the period 1980-2016 we report the figures as published in OECD SOCX. For the period 1960-1979, we extended the recent figures (from OECD SOCX) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1985). And for the period 1880-1930, we took observations from Lindert (2004).\\n\\nTo be precise, the data for the period 1960-1979 was obtained by relying on the earliest available observation from OECD SOCX, and then successively extending the series backwards by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD (1985). Here is an example:\\n\\nOECD_SOCX_(Year-1) = [OECD_SOCX_(Year)] x [OECD_1985_(year-1)]/[ OECD_1985_(year)]\\n\\nBackward extrapolation for the period 1960-1979 was necessary because the levels in the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. The implicit assumption, then, is that the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) have different levels, but common trends.\\n\\nIn this visualization (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/various-measures-of-social-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp?country=AUS) you can see how the various underlying sources compare to our constructed series.\\n\\nFurther remarks\\n\\nAccording to the Manual to the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), the OECD defines social expenditure as “The provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract or transfer”\\n\\nThe series on Social expenditure for France and Denmark in OECD(1985) are not complete. However, Lindert (2004) uses the data available to estimate social expenditure in 1960 and 1970. Therefore, we use his estimations to extrapolate backwards for those two points in time.\\n\\nIn OECD (1985) social expenditure figures include expenditure on education. To ensure consistency with Lindert (2004) and OECD (SOCX), we subtracted education."}, "595": {"dataPublishedBy": "OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX)", "dataPublisherSource": null, "link": "http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=SOCX_AGG", "retrievedDate": "01/04/2017", "additionalInfo": "In OECD (SOCX) the main social policy areas that form Social Expenditure are as follows: Old age, Survivors, Incapacity-related benefits, Health, Family, Active labor market programmes, Unemployment, Housing, and Other social policy areas.

The dataset presented here is 'Account at a financial institution (% age 15+)'. This dataset is predominantly sourced from household and census survey data. The World Bank defines this parameter as:\\n\\n\\\"the percentage of respondents who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution; having a debit card in their own name; receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months (% age 15+).\\n\\nEarlier global estimates of global access to financial services are less certain. To present earlier estimates, we have relied on composite measures of financial access reported in the World Bank's publication 'Finance for All?: Policies and Pitfalls in Expanding Access' (2008). The sources from which the World Bank draws upon for this composite indicator are referenced below.\\n\\nThe World Bank define this composite indicator as measuring \\\"the percentage of the adult population with access to an account with a financial intermediary. The indicator is constructed as follows: for any country with data on access from a household survey, the surveyed percentage is given. For other countries, the percentage is constructed as a function of the estimated number and average size of bank accounts as discussed in Honohan (2007). These numbers are subject to estimation error.\\\"\\n\\nIt should also be noted that while the majority of data is reported for the year 2005, some are sourced from earlier (thus the measurement period should be considered to extend from 2000-2005).\\nReferences:\\nWorld Bank. 2008.

Currently this data is not available as a time-series, and is limited to measurement in a single census year. Note that this census year is not consistent across all countries. Data for most European and North American countries is based on 2010-11 datasets, whereas other countries can extend from 1993-2011. For graphing consistency, this has been shown as a single year (e.g. assuming these figures are representative of 2011). The actual years of measurement for each country can be found in the referenced FAO report and database.\\n\\nThe FAO's publication on its Gender and Land Rights Database notes the following definition:\\n\\\"The agricultural landowner is defined as the legal owner of the agricultural land; however, definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys. The indicator may not necessarily reflect documented ownership certified by a legal document. Especially in places where much of the land is not formally titled or documented, surveys often simply ask whether someone in the household owns the land, and if so, who owns it. In addition to officially titled ownership, it may also include proxies, such as the right to use, sell or bequeath the land, or the right to use it as collateral. This enables the indicator to capture different aspects of the “bundle of rights” related to land, rather than land ownership in the strictest sense of the term. The current indicator in the GLRD uses different definitions of ownership; they are specified for each country in the data notes. As data for more countries become available, it will be useful to calculate these measures using more than one definition of ownership.\\n\\nAn individual is defined as a landowner whether they own land solely (they are the only owner of a plot of land) or jointly with someone inside or outside the household. Thus, households may have multiple landowners. In addition, households may own multiple plots of land with different owners identified for each plot.\\\"\\n\\nReferences:\\nFAO (2015).

For each year, we take the share of women in lower house of the parliament. This definition matches both with WDI and IPU’s Women in Parliament 1945-1995. They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments. Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year. If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.\\nHandling data issues: \\nFor years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament. For most countries, the values match exactly. However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match. As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003. Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps. For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016."}, "2830": {"dataPublishedBy": "Our World In Data (dataset constructed by Hannah Ritchie & Ruby Mittal)", "dataPublisherSource": "Data from 1270-1870 corresponds to Broadberry, S., Campbell, B.

Data on subgroups of the unaffiliated is also unavailable in many countries. Therefore, separate estimates are not possible for atheists or agnostics.\\nPew does not include “cultural” or “ethnic” Jews (i.e. people who have Jewish ancestry but do not describe their present religion as Jewish) in the people who identify their religion as Jewish. A 2013 Pew Research survey found that more than one-in-five U.S. Jewish adults (22%) say they are atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular (categorized as 'unaffiliated'), but consider themselves Jewish aside from religion and have at least one Jewish parent.

The quality and quantity of data vary across countries and time periods, which makes it not well-suited for time-series analyses. OWID uses two of their variables - military expenditure (milex) and military personnel (milper) - to construct this dataset. BOE exchange rates and US CPI are used to convert milex figures in constant US$. This allows comparison among countries in different years but with limitations. Finally, to extend milex series till 2016, figures from SIPRI’s Military Expenditure Database are spliced for the years 2013-2016.\\n\\nHosts of the NMC dataset, Professor Michael Greig and Professor Andrew Enterline, explain that the aim was to create a dataset which allowed for annual comparisons of the relative capabilities of states/countries in the international system. So NMC dataset is best for cross-sectional comparisons. Detailed description of original data is available here: http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/nmc-codebook-v5-1. However, military expenditure figures have been converted in constant currency units previously such as by SIPRI, World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) and Military Expenditures and Economic Growth, Castillo et al (2001). Thus, to be transparent and acknowledge data limitations, we explain below the way OWID has generated this dataset.\\n\\nData construction:\\nMilitary Personnel (milper)\\nMilper values were originally given in thousands. OWID multiplies those figures by thousand to produce the variable ‘Military personnel’. NMC dataset also reports total population of the country in a given year. The variable ‘Military personnel relative to total population’ is generated by taking the ratio of ‘Military personnel’ and ‘Total population’.\\nMilitary Expenditure (milex)\\nNMC dataset converted expenditure figures from national currency into a standard unit. However, it reports milex in thousands British pounds sterling prior to 1914 and in thousands US dollars thereafter. The decision to report milex in such a way reflects that UK was a dominant power before 1914 and US after that. We reconstruct milex data in the following way:\\nWe multiply milex values from NMC dataset by thousands. It gives military expenditure in British pounds from 1816-1913 and in US dollars from 1914-2012. We add to these, the milex values from SIPRI’s Database in US$ from 2013-2016. \\nEven though SIPRI provides milex values from 1949-2016, NMC dataset by COW Project is more complete for the overlapping years. Thus, we choose NMC dataset as our main dataset.\\nTo convert milex into current US$ from 1816-1913, we use exchange rates from Bank of England (BOE) dataset. As a result, we get military expenditures in current US$ for the entire period 1816-2012. \\nPlease note that we use BOE exchange rates because the original COW exchange rates are not available. While we are aware that using a different exchange rates for the period preceding 1914 introduces noise to the series, we believe that this does not affect trends or levels in any systematic way. It simply adds to the margin of error that historical estimates already had.\\nThen, we use US Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 1816-2016 to adjust for inflation. OWID uses 2015 as the base year i.e. price deflator in 2015 = 1. After dividing milex in current US$ by price deflator, we get military expenditure in constant 2015 US dollars. \\nSIPRI also provides milex data in constant 2015 US$. While the OWID reconstructed figures follow the same trend, two series are different. It is due to difference in methodologies used. SIPRI uses individual country’s CPI to first adjust for inflation, and then market exchange to convert national currency in 2015 US$. If there were perfect markets, both approaches should give same result as exchange rates would reflect changes in relative value of each currency over time.\\nFinally, for all three variables - Military expenditure, Military expenditure in current US$ and Military expenditure in constant US$ - we take their ratio relative to the total population to express variables in per capita terms."}, "6729": {"dataPublishedBy": null, "dataPublisherSource": null, "link": null, "retrievedDate": null, "additionalInfo": "Data on metal production is based on the combination of two sources.\\n\\nHistorical data from 1850-2011 is sourced from the ClioInfra database, available at: https://www.clio-infra.eu/ [accessed 9th September 2017].\\n\\nThis has been combined with recent data from the USGS Mineral Statistics from 2012 onwards.

More specifically, if the year of universal suffrage is less than 1990 for the United States, we coded ‘Universal suffrage to women’ in the United States in 1990 as Yes. Note that the United States had gained sovereignty by then. \\nIn addition, our dataset doesn’t consider these milestones as ordered achievements in women’s political representation. Paxton et al (2006) assumed that a country can only elect a woman MP once the universal suffrage has been granted. However, there are countries whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage.
