# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Our World In Data!

We are not currently accepting code contributions to this codebase, due to the large amount of work involved in bringing them to a state where they can be merged.

In 2023, we expect to do a major refactor of our data visualisation system, Grapher. Once that is complete, we'll revisit external conributors.

In the meantime, you can contribute to Our World In Data in the following ways:

- Attempt to run this codebase locally and [report any issues](https://github.com/owid-grapher/issues) you run into on Github
- Suggest improvements to our site by starting a [new discussion](https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher/discussions/new/choose)
- Report flaws in our writing or data by email to [`info@ourworldindata.org`](mailto:info@ourworldindata.org)
