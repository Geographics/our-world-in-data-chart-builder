Vite

-   [x] Fix up client settings
-   [x] Use "more dynamic" preview server url/port
-   [x] `yarn vite preview` doesn't work, because asset names are different
-   [x] Admin doesn't work
-   [x] Chunk naming: `faBook`
-   [ ] `embedCharts` snippet
-   [x] Get rid of webpack & maybe Storybook
-   [ ] Optional: Make use of some of the Vite SSR features (https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html), which would simplify the generation of the plugin-include scripts needed
-   [ ] Integrate VITE_PREVIEW mode
