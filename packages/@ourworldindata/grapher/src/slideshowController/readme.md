# SlideShowController

Our data explorers now have many hundreds of charts. Each one is reachable via a unique query string. This component creates a "slideshow" of query strings.

This mainly serves as a development tool to rapidly iterate through all the potential views during the development process.

It could evolve into something more user facing, or we may want to swap it out with some external library.
